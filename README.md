![IMG](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp10784400.jpg)

 The aim of our Airbnb booking analysis was to understand the factors influencing Airbnb prices in New York City and to identify patterns within the dataset. Our analysis provides valuable insights for travelers, hosts, and Airbnb as a platform, enhancing the understanding of New York City's dynamic hospitality landscape.-   Our analysis began with thorough data exploration and cleaning. This crucial phase involved understanding the data's characteristics, including data types, missing values, and value distributions. Simultaneously, we jump on the data cleaning process, addressing issues such as errors, missing values, and duplicates while removing outliers. This rigorous data preparation ensured the quality and integrity of our analysis, enabling us to work with accurate and reliable information.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Airbnb dataset to extract insights into host behaviors, area-specific trends, and predictive analysis related to property locations, prices, and reviews. The primary goals are to understand variations in listing traffic across different geographical areas and discern the underlying factors contributing to these differences.

## Business Objective

The business objective on Airbnb is to create a thriving online marketplace that connects travelers seeking accommodations with hosts who have available lodging. This platform aims to offer a wide range of lodging options to travelers, promote the utilization of spare or vacant properties, and facilitate seamless transactions between guests and hosts.

## Conclusion

The analysis underscores the importance of:
- **Distinct Neighborhood Dynamics:** In contrast, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island exhibit notably lower booking volumes and host counts. These areas likely cater to guests seeking budget-friendly accommodations or specific short-term requirements. Intriguingly, these neighborhood groups boast higher room availability compared to bustling areas like Brooklyn and Manhattan.
- **Differential Demand:** Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island exhibit comparatively lower booking numbers and host counts. These areas likely cater to guests seeking budget-friendly accommodations or those with specific short-term requirements, leading to higher room availability compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn.
